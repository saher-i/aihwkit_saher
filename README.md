 # IBM Analog Hardware Acceleration Kit Unit Cell Extension

This repository is the forked version of IBM's AIHW Kit (https://github.com/IBM/aihwkit.git)

# What is the project about?

Analog in-memory compute (AIMC) represents a promising alternative architectural approach to enhancing throughput and energy efficiency of matrix-vector multiplications (MVM), which are often the dominant operations within deep neural network applications. In this project, we will be adding hardware functionality to IBMâ€™s open-source AI Hardware Toolkit by extending the unit cell, the most fundamental circuit within our AIMC design, from two analog memory devices to four. In this design, neural network weights are typically represented using differential pairs of conductances W = G+ - G-. We will extend this functionality to W = F (G+ - G-) + g+ - g-, where four conductances now define the weight using a flexible scale factor F that can modulate the relative contributions and enable more accurate representations of broader weight distributions. Using multiple conductances also provides redundancy, which can improve network resilience (accuracy) in the presence of faulty or high variability devices.

# Outline of the Code Respository

-  => The repository consists of a 7 directories in total, my focus was on the modification of the 'src' directory.
-  => For implementation of my project, I made changes in the inference, simulator and nn directory within the src directory.
-  => In order to test my changes, I had to run the examples present in the examples directory.
